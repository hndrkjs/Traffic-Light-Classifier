# Traffic-Light-Classifier

In this project, I used computer vision techniques to build a classifier for images of traffic lights. The dataset consisted of traffic light images in which one of three lights is illuminated: red, yellow, or green. Completing this project included the following tasks:

**Loading and visualizing the data.** This step consisted of loading the data and visualizing them.
**Pre-processing.** The main step here is to sandardise the images.
**Feature extraction.** In this step I extracted some features from each image which will later be used in classifying them.
**Classification and visualizing error.** In this step I wrote a function that uses the extracted features to classify the images.
**Evaluate your model.** To pass this project, my classifier had to be >90% accurate and never classify any red lights as green. My classifier passed these requirements.
